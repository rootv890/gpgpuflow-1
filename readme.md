GPGPU vs FlowField

GPGPU -- General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit FlowField -- A field of
vectors that can be used to simulate fluid flow or other vector fields.

GPGPU is a technique that uses the GPU to perform general purpose computations
and flowfield is a technique that uses a field of vectors to simulate fluid flow
or other vector fields.
